The Contest is open and limited to students who are enrolled in an undergraduate institution within the United States. How can you use digital technology to develop an application that transforms education? For inspiration, we've provided a view example ideas that might get you thinking about the possibilities of what you could build: * **Mobile Applications:** Build a tablet or phone application for students, teachers, administrators, or learners of all ages. * **Time-saving tools:** Both students and teachers are pressed for time. Can you build an application that allows teachers or students to be more efficient, to learn or complete tasks outside of the physical or virtual classroom? * **Learning & Retention:** Can you build an immersive, fun, collaborative experience to engage students, promote learning and retention, personalize education, or promote social learning? * **Utilizing Technology:** What non-traditional educational technologies might you integrate with an on-line learning experience. Would you use your X-Box to submit a homework assignment? When ----- Begin submitting your idea on September 3, 2013 through September 30, 2013. Contestants will be notified by October 4, 2013 if their idea has been accepted. Contests must submit their final work by November 30, 2013. Winning submission will be announced on December 30, 2013.
